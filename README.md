I developed the project in order to improve my skills in React.js & Tailwind. I followed the entire tutorial offered by the channel, and after finishing the video, I added some things to the original project. The addition were:
- Animation on scroll with Aos
- Counter Up to stats in scrolling with CountrUp and react-scroll-trigger
